%Please carefully read the following instruction, as they will be different 
%for some sessions. 

%In this part, you will see one word at a time, which can be either an old
%word (i.e. you have seen it when making animacy judgements) or a new word.

%For old words, your task is to judge how frequently you have seen each of
%them on a 5-point relative scale, with 5 indicating the most frequent, and 
%1 the least frequent. 

%For new words, your task is to judge how much exposure you have with the
%thing the word represents, also on a 5-point relative scale, with 5 
%indicating the most amount of exposure, and 1 the least amount of 
%exposure.

%The two tasks will alternate in five-trial blocks. At the beginning of 
%each block, a message will remind you what the next five trials will be.

%Just to remind you how the keys are mapped on each of the 5 options:

%pressing with your left ring finger indicates a 5, with your left middle 
%fingle indicates a 4, with your left index finger indicates a 3, with your 
%right index finger indicates a 2, and with your right middle finger
