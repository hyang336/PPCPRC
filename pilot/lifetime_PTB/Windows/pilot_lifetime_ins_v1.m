% In this part of the experiment, you will see a list of words, one at a
% time. Your task is to judge how familiar you are with the thing that each
% word represents. Please base the judgements on your personal lifetime
% experience. For instance, a person who majored in neuroscience during his
% university years may have a lot of experience with "brain" but little
% experience with "stock", while a person who majored in business may say
% the opposite. You will indicate your judgement on a 5-point scale. 1
% means "not familiar at all", and 5 means "extremely familiar". You would
% choose '5' if the the word referred to something you had a great deal of
% experience with. Please consider even subtle differences when making
% these judgements and indicate it in a graded manner. You have 2.5 seconds
% to make each judgement.

% Press with your right middle finger to indicate a '1', with right index
% finger to indicate a '2', with left index finger to indicate a '3', with
% left middle finger to indicate a '4', and with left ring finger to
% indicate a '5'
