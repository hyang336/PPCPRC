% In this part of the experiment, you will see a list of words, one at a time. Your task
% is to judge, based on your lifetime experience, how familiar you are with the thing that
% each word represents. You will indicate your judgement on a 5-point scale. 1 means "not
% familiar at all", and 5 means "extremely familiar". You would choose '5' if the the word
% referred to something you had a great deal of experience with, perhaps even every day.
% Please consider even subtle differences when making these judgements and indicate it in
% a graded manner. You have 2.5 seconds to make each judgement.
