%button boxes. You will see number 1 through 5 on the

%swiftly and accurately. For each trial, if you made an
%incorrect response, a picture of the button box and the
%correct key would be indicated in a red box.

%your left index finger indicates a 2, with your right index
%finger indicates a 3, with your right middle finger
%indicates a 4, and with your right ring finger indicates a
