%In this part, you will see one word at a time, which can be
%either an old word (i.e. you have seen it when making
%animacy judgements) or a new word. For old words, your task
%is to judge how frequently you have seen each of them on a
%5-point scale, with 5 indicating the most frequent, and 1
%the least frequent. For new words, your task is to judge
%how familiar you are with the thing that the word
%represents based on your lifetime experience. For instance,
%most canadians would say they are more familiar with
%"apple" than "mango". But if you are a mango-enthusiast,
%you may say the opposite. The two tasks will alternate
%in five-trial blocks. At the beginning of each block, a
%message will inform you what the next five trials will
%be.[press your right index finger to go to next page]
