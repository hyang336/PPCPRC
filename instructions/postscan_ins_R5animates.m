% In this part, you will see all the words on which you made
% frequency judgements. Your task is to judge how familiar
% you are with the thing that each word represents based on
% your lifetime experience. You would choose '5' if the the
% word referred to something you had a great deal of
% experience with. Please consider even subtle differences
% when making these judgements and indicate it in a graded
% manner. You have limited time to make each judgement. So
% please do not languish an extraordinary amount of time on
% each word. Same as the previous phase, press with your
% left middle finger to indicate a '1', with left index
% finger to indicate a '2', with right index finger to
% indicate a '3', with right middle finger to indicate a
% '4', and with right ring finger to indicate a '5' If you
% have any question, please ask now. [When you are ready,
% press with your right middle finger to start]
