Several issues with the current procedure:
1) Once the ASHS is done for each subject, registering the segmentation to the MNI space results in them being fractured. For now the solution is to run ASHS directly on MNI template
2) Registering BOLD to MNI reslice the BOLD into 1mm-isotropic resolution, this doesn't seem right...Maybe I should run the analyses in using the fmriprep output in MNI space in the first place
3) 2nd level scripts not finished, the results generated so far are through the GUI
4) Should probably switch to single-trial GLM for the ease of testing interactions
5) Could I do the 1st-level in native T1 space, and not register them to a template for the 2nd level but just focusing on PRC (e.g. do most subjects have some activation in PRC > 0)?
6) should use fmriprep MNI-space BOLD if I want to do 2nd level GLM, since those are elastically registered using ANTS. In addition, I should increase the smoothing kernal to 8mm following Devin, to better align subjects anatomy.

Using whole-brain approach now instead of ASHS ROI.
Sum brain masks in MNI space generated by fmriprep for each participant to get an overall mask (thresholded at 0), which is passed as the explicit mask for every participant in the 1st level analysis while disabling the implicit masking in SPM. The 2nd level analysis has no mask at all since all participants use the same mask in the 1st level.
