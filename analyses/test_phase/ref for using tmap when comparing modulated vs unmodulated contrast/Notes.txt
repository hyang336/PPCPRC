the t value for a contrast is calculated roughly as the ratio of the beta-weight difference (defined by the contrast vector) and the sum of the standard errors of those betas (from the linear regression fit in the 1st level). The beta-weight difference (contrst) measure the strength of the linear relationship between familiarity and the fMRI data, while the standard errors measure the goodness of fit of the linear regression model FOR INDIVIDUAL BETAS. Thus, if adding parametric modulation improved the fit AND if there is a linear relationship between familiarity and fMRI data (i.e. the contrast is not zero), then we would expect that the t value for the familiarity contrast would increase because the redued denominator (i.e. sum of standard errors). This is under the assumption that the slope and the error of a regression line are independent. I cannot provide a proof for such independence. But if we think of the error as following a N(0,e), then reducing the error can be thought as reducing e in that normal distribution. With enough data points, the slope shouldn't be affected too much by such reduction.
